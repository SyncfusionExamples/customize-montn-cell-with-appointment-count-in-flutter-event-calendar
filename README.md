# How to customize the month cell with appointment count in the Flutter Calendar?

A quick-start example to help you to customize the month cell with appointment count in the Flutter Calendar.

The MonthCellBuilder allows you to design your custom view and assign the view to the month cells of the calendar by returning an appropriate widget in the monthCellBuilder of SfCalendar.

Using the [monthCellBuilder](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_calendar/latest/calendar/SfCalendar/monthCellBuilder.html) property of the calendar, you can customise the calendar month cell with appointment count in the Flutter Event Calendar. By using the MonthCellDetails widget, you can use the required widget for cell customization with appointment count.

Appointments will display on month cell builder widgets based on the appointment display mode.
